# Personalized News Aggregator

This is a personalized news aggregator built with Python and Streamlit. 
The application fetches news articles from the NewsAPI based on user-defined topics, summarizes them using AWS Nova Lite, and presents them in a structured and easy-to-read format. 
The goal of this project is to create an AI-powered tool that offers a personalized news reading experience.

## Features:
- Fetch news articles based on topics of the user's choice, like AI ethics, architecture, or art.
- Summarize the fetched articles using AWS Nova Lite (or HuggingFace transformers, depending on your choice).
- Display the news in a clean and structured format with titles, summaries, and links to the original articles.

## Requirements:
Before running this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check this by running:
